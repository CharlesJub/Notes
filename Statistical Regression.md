## Objectives of regression
- Regression is a means of exploring the variation in some quantity 
- Regression separates the EXPLAINED and UNEXPLAINED components. It can tell you how hockey games are impacted by shots on goals but it will also tell you how much in left unexplained 
## Population Regression Equation

Role of regression:
- Estimate the "betas"
- Quantify the errors
## Sample Regression Line
Creating a line of best fit for the data we have

Start with a average of y, Calculate squared residuals 

Aim to reduce the squared residuals 

## SSR / SSE / SST
SSR = Sum of squares due to Regression, Variance explained by the independent variables

SSE = Sum of Squares due to Error

SST = SSR + SSE

## R-Squared ($R^2$)

Explained sum of squares divided by the total

How much of the dependent variable is being explained by the independent variable 

High $R^2$ means line of best fit explains data well, or with little error

## Degrees of Freedom (DF) / Adj $R^2$
