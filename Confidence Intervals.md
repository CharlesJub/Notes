## Bootstrap 
![[Pasted image 20231113112257.png]]
1. Take a sample
2. Randomly select a subsample (duplicates are OK)

*Why are duplicates OK?* Look into sampling with replacement
3. Calculate mean of random sample 
4. Repeat steps 2-3 to get a lot of means

A 95% confidence interval is an interval that covers 95% of the bootstrapped means 

## Why are confidence intervals useful? 
Statistical tests performed visually

The p-value of anything outside of the confidence interval is <0.05, or statistically different. 

## Use cases
![[Pasted image 20231113113030.png]]
Because the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap, we know that there is a statistically significant differnece in the weights of female and male mice. 

If the confidence intervals overlap, you still have to do you [[t-test]]


## Example problem
1. The average test scores in a physics class is normally distributed with a standard deviation of 5.4. 50 scores with a sample mean of 79 were selected at random. 
	(a) Find a 95% confidence interval for the population mean test score. 
	(b) What is the value of the margin of error?
