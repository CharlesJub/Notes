# Notes:
## Chunking 
> Develop a mindset of no matter how unproductive your day is so far that you can still be productive for the next chunk of your day. AKA don't give up on being productive just because you wasted your morning/afternoon/whatever time of day it is

### What can I do now? 
Think about how I spend my day and find 4 2 hour chunks that I can block out. Add these chunks to my daily planner and record how productive I feel for each chunk.

## Postpone Dopamine
> Postpone dopamine- no phone or browsing, I can pull even 5h of high productivity like this daily, as a bonus when the workday is over I donâ€™t feel such a big urge to doomscroll anymore

### What can I do now? 
Create a reminder before bed and a habit tracker for postponing dopamine for a few hours after waking up.

## Reinforcing Habits
> Reinforcing habits - I always do 30 pushups before I sit down at my desk at the start of the day. At first I forgot a lot, but now I feel unfocused if I don't do it. I'm working on doing more at various points throughout the day just to get me out of the chair. (Desk-based job obviously.)

### What can I do now? 
Think of habits that I can do before a bout of work that will get me into the right mindset for a working block:
- Jumping Jacks
- Pushups
- Drink Water
- Deep Breaths 
- Step outside
- Close everything except for working window

## Atomic Habits
I've already read it. Recommended video summary: https://youtu.be/o7w5r5PfBKo?si=FWOz7oVkCO6Gvu_2

## Self-respect
>I ask myself what self-respect looks like (literally set it as my alarm label), and I do that. It's simple but powerful, and still allows grace for rest when I need it. Full credit to Ash Ambirge - I learned this from her awesome book, The Middle Finger Project.

### What can I do now? 
Think about what self respect looks like for me. Order The Middle Finger Project. Put a habit reminder to think about what self-respect looks like in my habit tracker. 

## Random Number 
> I draw a random number. All decisions where I have multiple choices will be taken according to this number. Saves lot of time and decision fatigue across the day. No more routine.

I think this is a joke, but I think there is some value in this idea. I've read in some places that every day you can only use so much brain power thinking so it is best to reduce the amount of time you spend on trivial tasks. One suggestion for this is to repeat the same thing every day. Wear the same clothes, eat the same food, etc. This random number joke could be useful for limiting the amount of time you spend thinking about trivial things while also keeping things fresh-ish.
