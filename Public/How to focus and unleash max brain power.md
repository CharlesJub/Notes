# Notes
- Sacred Space: designate an area that you only use for studying or working. Protect the space from distractions. Make sure it is clean. Natural Light. Sit and start.
- Sacred You: treat your time as sacred. Be aware of minor distractions. Keep track of micro distractions and think of ways to improve.
- Hard reset: Exercise, belly breathing.
- No timers: work as long as possible and take a break when you feel like you're focus is falling off. Use it if it helps, but don't adhere to it religiously. 
- Change your sacred space
- Change the task: if you're struggling try changing the difficulty of the task. Reserve the hard stuff for another day.
