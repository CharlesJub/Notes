Probability is the logic of uncertainty.
Probability has value in many different areas of our life.
It is easy to make errors when studying probability.

*Sample space* of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment. 
The sample space of an experiment can be finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite. 

Example:
A: card is an ace.
B: card has a black suit. 
D: card is a diamond. 
H: card is a heart.
A ∩ H: The event that the card is the Ace of Hearts
A ∩ B: The event that the card is {Ace of Spades, Ace of Clubs }
A ∪ D ∪ H: The event that the card is {Ace, Diamond, Heart}
$A^c$: The event that the card is not an Ace 
$(D ∪ H)^c = D^c ∩ H^c = B$: The event that a card is not a Diamond or Heart is the same as the event that a card isn't a Diamond and isn't a Heart, and is the same as the event that a card is a black suit.

Naive definition of probability: the number of ways the event could happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes. 
Called naive because it is restrictive and relies on strong assumptions.

Question: Why is it restrictive and what assumptions does it rely on?
