Notes: 
- Do one thing and do it well
- Separate commands and queries
- Only request information that you only need 
- Keep the number of parameters minimal 
- If something has too many parameters that might be an indication of a class that is too complex. If you still feel that the class is not too complex, try to form a class to store the data 
- Don't create and use an object in the same place 
- Don't use flag arguments. If you use a bool it probably means that it should be split into two functions. One for true and one for false  
- Quick naming tips:
	- If the function has and check if the function does one thing 
	- Functions should be actions 
	- Use consistent naming
