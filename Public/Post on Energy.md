>How can I be motivated everyday instead so I need discipline less?

You're missing information:

* **Energy**

It's important to understand that "doing stuff" is made up of 2 parts:

1. **Motivation:** Your *willingness* to do something, by *choice*
2. **Energy:** Your *ability* to turn that choice into action, through *effort*

Imagine your task like the opposite shore of a river.  You are *motivated* to get to the other side (i.e. you WANT to get to the other side), but you have to cross a bridge in order to get there, which involves the *effort* of walking.  If you are too tired to walk, then it's not a question of **motivation**, it's a question of **energy**.  You are trying to cross that bridge every day, for every task, but your energy is low, which is why you're having a hard time all the time!

One of the biggest traps in the world of personal productivity is conflating those two things, because then we beat ourselves up about not being "motivated" enough, not having enough willpower, not having enough discipline, etc.  Here's the simple question to identify if you're really just "lazy" or not:

* If you had the **energy** to do your task, would you jump on it & get it done right away?

Well of course!  Think about this: there are high-energy people out there tearing up the world, for better or for worse.  You've got Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, etc.  Elon brags all the time about working 100-hour weeks & sleeping at his office, which isn't something that people with low energy have the capability of doing!

>I'm tired of pushing myself through things by through discipline. It all gets too boring and exhausting. Forcing your way on the task up to its completion is draining.

So let's look at the words you used to describe your current situation:

* Pushing
* Boring
* Exhausting
* Draining

These aren't words of motivation (willingness); these are words of **low energy**.  Thus, your primary job right now is:

1. Find out your root cause(s) for your low energy
2. Learn how to eliminate or manage them

I went to high school in the late 90's, which is when I got into self-help books.  I didn't understand why I procrastinated & couldn't get myself to just "do" stuff.  My room was always a mess, my grades were always poor, and I even struggled with doing things I LIKED to do!

As it turned out, everyone else was simply cheating!  They had access to high physical energy & strong mental clarity, whereas I would just run around tired with brain fog all the time!  It wasn't that I didn't WANT to meet my commitments on-time & enjoy doing them, it was that I was exhausted ALL the time, so everything felt like a CHORE!  It was completely demoralizing because I had to fight an uphill, Sisyphus-like battle day after day after day, which was just *completely draining* to deal with!

So it's REALLY important to understand that you're not dealing with a *motivation* issue - you already WANT to be successful - what you're dealing with is an ENERGY issue.  This is vital to understand because that information is going to guide you into what to do next to improve your situation.  This is what I would suggest doing immediately:

1. Schedule an appointment with your GP
2. Do a full annual physical
3. Do a full blood panel to see if you have any obvious deficiencies in your body (ex. low iron levels)
4. Do an A1C test to check your 3-month historical blood sugar levels
5. Do a sleep apnea test

This will rule out the common things that make people tired all the time.  For me, it was a little more complicated.  I ended up having a number of health issues that, once treated, have MASSIVELY helped my productivity improve over the years.  Some of them include:

* [ADHD](https://www.reddit.com/r/kaidomac/comments/qnqa6p/adhd_101/)
* [Histamine intolerance](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/ytmcl4/comment/iw75m9l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
* [Sleep apnea](https://www.reddit.com/r/kaidomac/comments/s15jmk/sleep_apnea_sleeping_system/)

Generally, when we feel good, we experience something I call the "warm fuzzy", where we're fine existing in the moment, are able to engage in self-directed action, aren't anxious about the past, and aren't worried about the future.  This is like enjoying stepping outside in the sun!  So then we get into two modes:

1. Day Mode
2. Night Mode

Day Mode is where we have energy; Night Mode is where we don't have energy, so we have to push a little harder.

## 2/3 
part 2/3

There are 6 levels in total:

**Day Mode:**

1. Positive Apathy
2. Good
3. Great

**Night Mode:**

1. Negative Apathy
2. Internal Resistance
3. Can't Mode

There are different levels of feeling good.  Sometimes we feel pretty good & are able to easily get through our day.  Sometimes we feel really great...we have exciting stuff to do, we have cool people to do it with, we have lots & lots of energy, we got a ton of sleep last night, we had a great breakfast, etc.

It starts to get weird as our energy gets lower, however.  There comes a point where there's a fork on the road, which is either positive or negative apathy.  Sometimes we just feel fine, which is when we experience positive apathy...like, should we do this task?  Meh, sure, why not.

Negative apathy happens when our energy starts to sink out of Day Mode.  That's when we look at a task and say, meh...nah.  That happens when we don't have enough energy to care AND push ourselves forward into taking action.  It's a fine line because sometimes we're kinda tired & kinda don't care, but if we have enough juice inside of us, we can engage in positive apathy & at least get our tasks done.

Internal resistance is really where things start to get difficult.  This is a little different than negative apathy, because not only do we struggle with caring, but now we feel that resistance inside of us.  There are 3 levels of resistance:

1. Silent resistance
2. Palpable tension
3. Access pain

Silent resistance is that weird mode where we just can't get ourselves to do stuff & we don't know why.  It's a little bit different than negative apathy, because with apathy, we just have a hard time having enough energy to care, but with silent resistance, it's like there's an invisible wall preventing us from going forward.

Silent resistance is a CLEAR sign of low energy!  However, our brain makes up stories about how we're just lazy, unmotivated, unwilling, undisciplined, weak, or have no willpower, when really, we just don't have the internal fuel to do what we want to do easily!

But sometimes it gets worse than that & we encounter *palpable* tension.  Not necessarily full-on pain where things *hurt* necessarily, but we'll start to get somatic responses, like getting tired, or getting a tension headache, or feeling drained, as if someone pulled the plug on our energy.  This can act as a really strong deterrent due to PEM energy issues:

* Physical
* Emotional
* Mental

When our brain sees that our energy is low, it acts like a dog barking as a warning to stay away from using our remaining energy!  So when we try to put in the effort into thinking about or doing something, it throws up those flares to try to make us STOP!  That could be draining us physically, or making us feel bad emotionally with things like depression or anxiety or panic attacks, or giving us brain fog to prevent us from mentally clarifying & committing to doing our tasks.  Our brain kind of groups things into two areas:

1. Prospect fatigue
2. Execution fatigue

Prospect fatigue is when we experience those deterrents merely by *thinking* about doing stuff.  It's like if your friend wants to hang out on a weekday after a long day at school or work & you think about going out to do stuff & your whole brain & body are just like naaaaah.  Execution fatigue, on the other hand, has 3 levels:

1. Starting
2. Sustaining
3. Stopping

So when we go to do tasks, sometimes it's REALLY hard to use what little energy we have to get started.  Then once we DO get rolling, having enough energy to stick with it & not quit & not gloss over our tasks quickly can be really difficult.  Then once we DO get on a roll, it can be hard to shift gears in order to get our other tasks done & go to bed at a reasonable hour!

part 2/3
## 3/3
part 3/3

Essentially, when we have energy, we can do anything with no resistance.  When our energy is low, our brain checks on our fuel levels & believes the fake news that if we run out of energy, we're going to die painfully.  Because our brain is under the false impression that if we use up all of our remaining dopamine (mental fuel) that we're painfully die, it throws up STRONG physical, emotional, and mental deterrents to prevent us from engaging in behavior that would drain our remaining fuel reserves, which again, is fake news!

Then when we're REALLY clobbered, we run into the third level of internal resistance, which is access pain.  This is when we experience pain accessing our executive functions & our physical body.  That's when we start getting the headaches, the migraines, the debilitating fatigue, the soul-crushing negative emotions of depression, and so on.  Having dealt with chronic illness my whole life, I only discovered LAST YEAR that when people said that they were tired, that they weren't referring to the same DEBILITATING FATIGUE that I experienced!

The final level of Night Mode is "can't mode".  It's when we experience "task paralysis" & our body just doesn't want to respond to our brain's commands to get moving!  This is when we have to simply call it quits & eat some protein & take a nap, haha!  Productivity is sort of broken up into two parts:

1. Clarity
2. Energy

First, we have to define what we want, because now we know what to work on: homework, chores, personal projects, etc.  Then we need the ENERGY to get them done.  When we feel good, we may experience feeling fine, good, or great.  Feeling super motivated & energetic is awesome, but unfortunately, we don't always get to experience those states of mood!  So then we have to learn how to work in the Grind State:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/kaidomac/comments/y7nzj0/no\_more\_zero\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/kaidomac/comments/y7nzj0/no_more_zero_days/)

That's when we experience apathy, resistance, and task paralysis.  Once you are able to clear see that most productivity issues really have to do with energy, you can start to see EXACTLY where your energy level is at:

* Are you feeling apathetic & just don't seem have be able to muster up the energy to care?
* Do you feel like there's an invisible wall of silent resistance in front of you, preventing you from simply deciding to do something & then doing it?
* Are you experiencing palpable tension in the form of fatigue, tension headaches, anxiety, brain fog, trouble thinking clearly, problems remembering things, and so on?  Are you re-reading the same paragraph over & over again in your textbook or seem to automatically get distracted by things like scrolling on your phone?
* Do you have literal **pain** accessing your physical body & your mental executive functions?  This can trigger strong responses including things like headaches, stomachaches, migraines, acid reflux, etc.
* Are you completely unable to get yourself into gear & are stuck in task paralysis mode?

So this is why it's really important to understand that what you're dealing with is an energy issue, not an issue of *wanting* to do it.  You WANT to cross that river, you WANT to get to the other side, but mustering up the energy to cross that bridge is hard when you're totally zapped, because then everything feels like a huge chore!

It's taken me literally *years* to clarify the information above, but now I'm able to pinpoint *exactly* which energy mode I'm in!  This is really helpful because my brain likes to make up stories about why I'm not doing stuff & why things are hard, when really, I just don't have enough fuel in my tank to care, to execute, and to ENJOY getting things done sometimes!

In turn, this helps me to plan out workarounds.  Like, if I'm in "can't" mode, then all I'm going to be doing is spinning my tires & not going anywhere, so it's best to have a protein snack & then take a nap, because nothing is going to get done anyway!

Or sometimes I'm facing apathy or internal resistance & need an extra boost to help me get things done.  When that happens, I like to use a "body double", which is simply asking another person to hang out with me to help motivate me into action:

Sometimes I just need a little extra clarity, because when things our vague, my brain tends to clam up:

Anyway, the bottom line is:

* You are struggling with **energy** issues (effort barriers), not motivation issues (desire)
* There are multiple levels of low energy & an endless list of deterrents that our brain uses to try to talk us out of expending our energy when it is low (including making us feel terrible emotionally & make it feel like everything is REALLY REALLY hard all the time!)
* **Your job is to find your root cause(s) of your low energy & then work to either eliminate or manage them so that you have enough energy every day to enjoyably execute your tasks!**
