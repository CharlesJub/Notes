# Notes
- Habits are a big part of who we are. What we do habitually makes up a lot of what we do entirely.
- Habits are learned 
- Goal-based habits: habits designed to get an immediate outcome each time you do them. (Example: Working out 60 minutes a day).
- *Zone 2 cardio*
- Identity-based habits: A habit with a larger over-arching theme to the habit. (Example: You're trying to be more fit, so you workout).
- Why is the distinction important? The role of dopamine and how it impacts how likely you are to stick to a habit. The two types of habits have different dopamine release times.
- How long does it take for a habit to form? Dependent on person and habit. 
- Potential good habit: Walk after dinner. Helps digestion
- Limbic friction: the strain that is required to overcome two different states present in your body. Anxiety and Laziness.
- A lot of habit formation is about being in the right state of mind and being able to control your body and mind. 
- Linchpin-Habits: Habits that make other habits easier to preform. Things you enjoy doing.
