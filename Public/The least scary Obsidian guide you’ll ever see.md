Notes: 

A lot of guides like this are overly complex. Okay for entertainment or to see what other people are doing, but toxic for actual productivity. 

Simply, Obsidian is just a folder with markdown files in it.

Themes: can install some themes or create your own.
[[Obsidian Themes]], Suggests minimal theme with brighter accent 


Ctrl+,: Shortcut for settings 

[[Obsidian Community Plugins]]
