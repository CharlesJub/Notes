# Notes

> The Law of Serendipity: Lady Luck favors the one who
> tries

## Foreword
> Henri Poincaré was a nineteenth-century mathematician who once described how he cracked a difficult mathematical problem that he had been intensively working on for weeks without success. **He took a vacation.**

I think this is alluding to the diffuse mode of learning. Where you learn some things by not focusing too hard on the subject and letting your mind work in the background.

> Surprisingly, your brain can also work on a problem even while you are sleeping and are not aware of anything. But it does this **only if you concentrate on trying to solve the problem before falling asleep.**

I think this is alluding to the relationship between focus mode and diffuse mode.

## Preface
> They most commonly use the strategy of _repeated reading_—simply reading through books or notes over and over. We and other researchers have found that **this passive and shallow strategy often produces minimal or no learning.**


> We don’t engage in passive rereading because we are dumb or lazy. We do it because we fall prey to a cognitive illusion.

Interesting that the ability to process what you read is not a sign that you have fully learned the information from the book.

## Chapter 1: Open the Door
Author hated math. She liked other things like language and she had confidence and interest when learning these topics and so she spent more time learning them. 

>the better I got, the more I enjoyed what I was doing. And the more I enjoyed what I was doing, the more time I spent on it. My success reinforced my desire to practice, and that built more success.

> I reflected on the progress of my career and realized that I’d followed my inner passions without also being open to developing new ones. As a consequence, I’d inadvertently pigeonholed myself.

I think this is an important thing to avoid. In my case, I like sports analytics, but I have effectively pigeonholed myself into only looking for work in that field with my projects. 

## Chapter 2: Easy Does It
> Being able to toggle your thinking—getting a glimpse of what you are learning before returning later to more fully understand what’s going on, is itself one of the main ideas in the book!

 **Actionable Advice**:  Take a picture walk of a chapter. Taking a quick glance ahead helps organize thoughts.

Focused Mode: Highly attentive state of thinking

Diffuse Mode: More relaxed mode of thinking

You're not consciously in both at the same time, but the diffuse mode can work in the background on something you're not actively focusing on.

Diffuse mode is associated with "big-picture"

> Diffuse-mode insights often flow from preliminary thinking that’s been done in the focused mode.

In the focused mode  you can get stuck in one area of thought leading to frustration and inability to solve a problem. Diffuse mode allows thoughts to span more approaches and is vital in problem solving.  

Einstellung effect: when you settle on solving a problem with a previously known solution, leading away from the best solution being discovered.

> **If you are trying to understand or figure out something new, your best bet is to turn off your precision-focused thinking and turn on your “big picture” diffuse mode**

So, the best way to learn something new is to spend a little time getting it into your brain then not focusing on it to let diffuse mode work. 

*How do you know when to get back to the topic after letting diffuse mode work?* 

> Long enough to latch on to a new, more fruitful approach

I guess if you aren't finding success with diffuse mode in finding a new approach you should go back with focus mode to get more context and insight. 

> The harder you push your brain to come up with something creative, the less creative your ideas will be.

I think this is a good reason for why procrastination is bad, beyond the obvious problems. Sometimes you make yourself think the pressure is allowing you to do your best work, but it is just allowing you to produce the most work through stress. Even if you're a serial procrastinator, it's important to look at the material early to let diffuse mode come up with some ways of attacking the problem. 

> **To** **learn about and be creative in math and science, we** **need to strengthen and use both the focused and diffuse modes.**

*How do we go about strengthening each mode of thinking? Is it just from repeated use or is there training specific to each mode?*

> Brighter students, in particular, can have difficulty in this way—their breezing through high school leaves them no reason to think that being confused is normal and necessary.

I think this is a very common thing with the Honors and AP systems that are currently in schools. A lot of times being in these classes are more about the amount of work your willing to do and not how good you are in these topics. 

> Articulating your question is 80 percent of the battle

That is why it is so valuable to be able to put the information in your own words

> One mode will process the information it receives and then send the result back to the other mode.

Interesting. I thought it was more of the focus sending info to the diffuse, but it makes sense for diffuse to also send info back about potential approaches to the problem.

**Actionable Advice**: Pomodoro Technique 25 minutes of focused work, 5 minutes of relaxation.

They are fine with social media and using your phone. Some Pomodoro people are against that stating that it is not effective relaxation. 

**Actionable Advice**: Imagine you at the end of the day, you're reflecting on the most important task you completed that day. Write what that task would be. Then work on it. Try to complete three 25 minute sessions. Better yet write down things you want to work on tomorrow. This allows your diffuse more to prepare.

### Summing in up
- Two processes for thinking: focused and diffuse
- You only use one at a time
- It is normal to not understand things the first time we focus on them
- To learn new things we need to start by focusing, then drop that focus and let diffuse mode work
- Einstellung effect is not understanding a problem or concept because you become fixed on a flawed approach
- Switching modes helps combat the Einstellung effect

### Recall
There are two modes of thinking. Focus and diffuse. To learn something new you need to focus first to get that information into your brain and then turn your focus away to process that infomation. Diffuse mode is about big picture thinking. It helps you produce different approaches to a problem. This is important because there is the Einstellung effect. The Einstellung effect is when you get stuck on a problem because you are stuck in a flawed approach. Diffuse mode combats this. A simple technique for combating procrastination is the pomodoro technique. 25 minutes of focused work 5 minutes of break. You can expand this technique to a full day by writing down what tasks you want to complete and doing 3 sessions towards that goal. The act of writing down the task helps the start of using diffuse mode.

#### Things I missed: 
It's okay to get stuck that is normal. You can only use one mode at a time. It's normal to not understand things the first time we see them. 

### Enhance your learning
1. How would you recognize when you are in the diffuse mode? How does it feel to be in the diffuse mode?
	I think you are in the diffuse mode when you are sporadically thinking about things that you have focused on recently. It is relaxing to be in the diffuse mode. There is no pressure to think about any specific topic. When you do think of an idea you can dig into it as much as you like. You can also jump to other ideas without care.
2. When you are consciously thinking of a problem, which mode is active and which is blocked? What can you do to escape this blocking?
	When you  are thinking of a problem you are using Focused mode and blocking Diffuse mode. To escape the blocking of the diffuse mode you can take a break and not focus on a specific thing.
3. Recall an episode where you experienced the _Einstellung_ effect. How were you able to change your thinking to get past the preconceived, but erroneous, notion?
	I don't have an exact example, but this has definitely happened to me while coding. I can't figure out a problem only to think of a way to solve it in the shower or on a walk.  
4. Explain how the focused and diffuse modes might be equated to an adjustable beam on a flashlight. When can you see farther? When can you see more broadly, but less far?
	The focused mode is like a narrow beam of light. You can see farther but only a small area. The diffuse mode is a wider beam of light. You can see more but in less detail.
5. Why is procrastination sometimes a special challenge for those who are studying math and science?
	Procrastination is a problem because you only allow yourself to do focused-mode learning. This means you create a bad foundation for future learning. And this is important in these topics because each idea builds on past ideas.
