# Notes

> The Law of Serendipity: Lady Luck favors the one who
> tries

## Foreword
> Henri Poincaré was a nineteenth-century mathematician who once described how he cracked a difficult mathematical problem that he had been intensively working on for weeks without success. **He took a vacation.**

I think this is alluding to the diffuse mode of learning. Where you learn some things by not focusing too hard on the subject and letting your mind work in the background.

> Surprisingly, your brain can also work on a problem even while you are sleeping and are not aware of anything. But it does this **only if you concentrate on trying to solve the problem before falling asleep.**

I think this is alluding to the relationship between focus mode and diffuse mode.

## Preface
> They most commonly use the strategy of _repeated reading_—simply reading through books or notes over and over. We and other researchers have found that **this passive and shallow strategy often produces minimal or no learning.**


> We don’t engage in passive rereading because we are dumb or lazy. We do it because we fall prey to a cognitive illusion.

Interesting that the ability to process what you read is not a sign that you have fully learned the information from the book.

## Chapter 1: Open the Door
Author hated math. She liked other things like language and she had confidence and interest when learning these topics and so she spent more time learning them. 

>the better I got, the more I enjoyed what I was doing. And the more I enjoyed what I was doing, the more time I spent on it. My success reinforced my desire to practice, and that built more success.

> I reflected on the progress of my career and realized that I’d followed my inner passions without also being open to developing new ones. As a consequence, I’d inadvertently pigeonholed myself.

I think this is an important thing to avoid. In my case, I like sports analytics, but I have effectively pigeonholed myself into only looking for work in that field with my projects. 

## Chapter 2: Easy Does It
> Being able to toggle your thinking—getting a glimpse of what you are learning before returning later to more fully understand what’s going on, is itself one of the main ideas in the book!

 **Actionable Advice**:  Take a picture walk of a chapter. Taking a quick glance ahead helps organize thoughts.

Focused Mode: Highly attentive state of thinking

Diffuse Mode: More relaxed mode of thinking

You're not consciously in both at the same time, but the diffuse mode can work in the background on something you're not actively focusing on.

Diffuse mode is associated with "big-picture"

> Diffuse-mode insights often flow from preliminary thinking that’s been done in the focused mode.

In the focused mode  you can get stuck in one area of thought leading to frustration and inability to solve a problem. Diffuse mode allows thoughts to span more approaches and is vital in problem solving.  

Einstellung effect: when you settle on solving a problem with a previously known solution, leading away from the best solution being discovered.

> **If you are trying to understand or figure out something new, your best bet is to turn off your precision-focused thinking and turn on your “big picture” diffuse mode**

So, the best way to learn something new is to spend a little time getting it into your brain then not focusing on it to let diffuse mode work. 

*How do you know when to get back to the topic after letting diffuse mode work?* 

> Long enough to latch on to a new, more fruitful approach

I guess if you aren't finding success with diffuse mode in finding a new approach you should go back with focus mode to get more context and insight. 

> The harder you push your brain to come up with something creative, the less creative your ideas will be.

I think this is a good reason for why procrastination is bad, beyond the obvious problems. Sometimes you make yourself think the pressure is allowing you to do your best work, but it is just allowing you to produce the most work through stress. Even if you're a serial procrastinator, it's important to look at the material early to let diffuse mode come up with some ways of attacking the problem. 

> **To** **learn about and be creative in math and science, we** **need to strengthen and use both the focused and diffuse modes.**

*How do we go about strengthening each mode of thinking? Is it just from repeated use or is there training specific to each mode?*

> Brighter students, in particular, can have difficulty in this way—their breezing through high school leaves them no reason to think that being confused is normal and necessary.

I think this is a very common thing with the Honors and AP systems that are currently in schools. A lot of times being in these classes are more about the amount of work your willing to do and not how good you are in these topics. 

> Articulating your question is 80 percent of the battle

That is why it is so valuable to be able to put the information in your own words

> One mode will process the information it receives and then send the result back to the other mode.

Interesting. I thought it was more of the focus sending info to the diffuse, but it makes sense for diffuse to also send info back about potential approaches to the problem.

**Actionable Advice**: Pomodoro Technique 25 minutes of focused work, 5 minutes of relaxation.

They are fine with social media and using your phone. Some Pomodoro people are against that stating that it is not effective relaxation. 

**Actionable Advice**: Imagine you at the end of the day, you're reflecting on the most important task you completed that day. Write what that task would be. Then work on it. Try to complete three 25 minute sessions. Better yet write down things you want to work on tomorrow. This allows your diffuse more to prepare.

### Summing in up
- Two processes for thinking: focused and diffuse
- You only use one at a time
- It is normal to not understand things the first time we focus on them
- To learn new things we need to start by focusing, then drop that focus and let diffuse mode work
- Einstellung effect is not understanding a problem or concept because you become fixed on a flawed approach
- Switching modes helps combat the Einstellung effect

### Recall
There are two modes of thinking. Focus and diffuse. To learn something new you need to focus first to get that information into your brain and then turn your focus away to process that infomation. Diffuse mode is about big picture thinking. It helps you produce different approaches to a problem. This is important because there is the Einstellung effect. The Einstellung effect is when you get stuck on a problem because you are stuck in a flawed approach. Diffuse mode combats this. A simple technique for combating procrastination is the pomodoro technique. 25 minutes of focused work 5 minutes of break. You can expand this technique to a full day by writing down what tasks you want to complete and doing 3 sessions towards that goal. The act of writing down the task helps the start of using diffuse mode.

#### Things I missed: 
It's okay to get stuck that is normal. You can only use one mode at a time. It's normal to not understand things the first time we see them. 

### Enhance your learning
1. How would you recognize when you are in the diffuse mode? How does it feel to be in the diffuse mode?
	I think you are in the diffuse mode when you are sporadically thinking about things that you have focused on recently. It is relaxing to be in the diffuse mode. There is no pressure to think about any specific topic. When you do think of an idea you can dig into it as much as you like. You can also jump to other ideas without care.
2. When you are consciously thinking of a problem, which mode is active and which is blocked? What can you do to escape this blocking?
	When you  are thinking of a problem you are using Focused mode and blocking Diffuse mode. To escape the blocking of the diffuse mode you can take a break and not focus on a specific thing.
3. Recall an episode where you experienced the _Einstellung_ effect. How were you able to change your thinking to get past the preconceived, but erroneous, notion?
	I don't have an exact example, but this has definitely happened to me while coding. I can't figure out a problem only to think of a way to solve it in the shower or on a walk.  
4. Explain how the focused and diffuse modes might be equated to an adjustable beam on a flashlight. When can you see farther? When can you see more broadly, but less far?
	The focused mode is like a narrow beam of light. You can see farther but only a small area. The diffuse mode is a wider beam of light. You can see more but in less detail.
5. Why is procrastination sometimes a special challenge for those who are studying math and science?
	Procrastination is a problem because you only allow yourself to do focused-mode learning. This means you create a bad foundation for future learning. And this is important in these topics because each idea builds on past ideas.




Tips from someone that has improved their learning:
- Read the book
- Skim first then read in detail
- Read multiple times (not in a row)
- If you still don't understand find other sources to see different points of view 
- Find a task that you think clearly in (this persons task is driving). Something that keeps you somewhat occupied to make sure you don't get bored or distracted.

## Chapter 3: Learning is Creating
There is power in knowing how to effectively switch from focused to diffuse mode.

Rule 1 for entering diffuse mode: Do something else that frees your brain from thinking about the problem. 

Going focus -> diffuse generally takes several hours. To use time effectively spend a little time each day on multiple topics instead of planning out large chunks for one topic.

Breaks are powerful. 

Everyone has different methods for relaxing. Howard Gruber: bed, bath, bus, Alexander Williamson: solitary walks

Falling asleep is a fool-proof way to enter diffuse mode.

> There is a deep connection between technical, scientific, and artistic creativity.

Math and science are creative in the fact that each rule or theory has many potential approaches or ways of understanding them. You need to be creative to come up with them

Creativity is about using previous knowledge in a new way.

# Left off: Edison’s story reminds us of something else. _We learn a_ _great deal from our failures in math and science._

> Know that you are making progress with each mistake you catch when trying to solve a problem—finding errors should give you a sense of satisfaction.

> “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” - Edison

Start early on your assignment and keep your working sessions short.

Sleep is the best form of diffuse mode

Diffuse mode isn't a substitute for hard focused thinking, but it is necessary for learning. 

You can only do so much focused mode thinking in a day. 

Potential Diffuse Mode Rewards: 
- Jog, walk, or swim
- Drive
- Shower
- Music without words
- Meditate
- Sleep

In brief segments (they can bring you into focused mode):
- Video games
- Reading 
- Texting
- TV

Comparing yourself to others can make you feel the need to speed up learning, but that will make your knowledge base weaker.

> Blinking in a vital activity that provides another means of reevaluating a situation

> Figuring out a difficult problem or learning a new concept almost always requires one or more periods when you aren’t consciously working on the problem.

When you are first learning new things don't have a gap larger than a day between focused mode practice. 

When you are stuck try to find another perspective from people you know. 

Learn the basic concepts before talking to someone else so you receive the information better.

Working memory is the things that you are working on. Can only hold 4 things. Need to be maintained actively

You keep things in working memories with repetition 

Long term memory is a database. To make sure you can retrieve the information you need to revisit it when you first put the memory into long term memory

Long term memory is where you store fundamentals needed for problem solving 

Spaced repetition: spacing repetition of a topic out over time

To sleep, slow you breathing and don't put pressure on the act of sleeping. Don't sleep too long or you can be groggy

Sleep is a vital part of memory. It erases trivial aspects of memories and strengthens key ideas 

Sleep is a deeper form of diffuse mode. It allows areas of the brain to focus on problem solving instead things that it would normally think about while awake. 

If you go over the material that is difficult you can increase the chance you dream about it. Setting it in mind that you want to dream about a topic also increases you chances.

A sleep-deprived brain can't make the same connections as a well-rested brain

Be ready to write down things that come to you before or after you sleep. Those thoughts can sometimes be of value

### Summing it up
- Focused mode to get information into the brain
- Then relax and let diffuse mode make new connections
- When you are struggling that is a sign to let diffuse mode take over
- A little every day is the best approach for technical fields.
- Use pomodoro to combat procrastination
-  Two memory systems. Working memory is limited to only four items and each item needs to be maintained. Long-term memory can hold lots of items but needs to be maintained by revisiting the items stored.
- Spaced repetition helps move items from working memory to long-term memory
- Sleep is an important part of learning. It helps you:
	- Make neural connections needed for normal thinking processes
	- Figure out tough problems and find meaning in what you're learning
	- Strengthen and rehearse the important parts of what you are learning and prune away trivialities.

### Recall: [[2023-11-16]]
- Get information into the brain with focused mode 
- Switch to diffuse mode to let the brain make new connections with the information introduced in focused mode
- If you get stuck it's a sign to relax and let diffuse mode work on the problem for a little bit.
- A little bit each day is the best approach for math and science
- Two storage systems in the brain. Working and Long-term
	- Working memory is limited to four things and needs to constantly be maintained 
	- Long-term memory takes some time to store things, but is much larger in the amount of things able to be stored. Need to occasionally revisit things in long-term memory to maintain them
- Sleep is an important part of learning
	- You need it to make new neural connections
	- Work through tough problems and find meaning in what is being learned
	- Strengthen key ideas and wash away unimportant bloat. 

Missed: 
* Pomodoro to combat procrastination
* Spaced repetition helps get information from working memory to long-term memory 

### Enhance your learning
1. Name some activities you would find helpful for switching from focused to diffuse mode.

2. Sometimes you can feel certain you have explored new approaches to analyzing a problem, when you actually haven’t. What can you do to become more actively aware of your thinking processes to help keep yourself open to other possibilities? Should you always keep yourself open to new possibilities?

3. Why is it important to use self-control to make yourself stop doing something? Can you think of times outside studying and academics when this skill might also be important?

4. When you are learning new concepts, you want to review the material within a day so that the initial changes you made in your brain don’t fade away. But your mind often becomes preoccupied with other matters—it’s easy to let several days or more pass before you get around to looking at the material. What kind of action plan could you develop to ensure that you review important new material in a timely fashion?
