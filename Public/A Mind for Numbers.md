# Notes
> The Law of Serendipity: Lady Luck favors the one who
> tries


## Foreword
> Henri Poincaré was a nineteenth-century mathematician who once described how he cracked a difficult mathematical problem that he had been intensively working on for weeks without success. **He took a vacation.**

I think this is alluding to the diffuse mode of learning. Where you learn some things by not focusing too hard on the subject and letting your mind work in the background.

> Surprisingly, your brain can also work on a problem even while you are sleeping and are not aware of anything. But it does this **only if you concentrate on trying to solve the problem before falling asleep.**

I think this is alluding to the relationship between focus mode and diffuse mode.
