Many different reasons why a outcome might happen that has nothing to do with the input 

**p-values are numbers between 0 and 1 that quantify how confident two tests are different** 

The closer a p-value is to 0 the more confidence that two tests are different 

Commonly used threshold is 0.05.

A small p-value when there is no difference is called a [[False Positive]].

A p-value of 0.05 means there is a 5% chance that test A and test B are only different because of randomness

The p-values helps decide if we should reject the null hypothesis 

null hypothesis is that the drugs are the same
