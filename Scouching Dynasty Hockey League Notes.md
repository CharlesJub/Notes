# Notes:
- League has a lot of prospect focused managers. Meaning:
	- Prospects are valued highly
	- Promising prospects are picked up quick (need to find a way to beat them to non-drafted players)
- Need to remember there is value in open roster slots. 

# To-do
- Find a trade to open a roster spot:
	- Expiring players:
		- Justin Schultz, 3M (UFA), 1.39 FP/G
		- Colin Miller, 1.85M (UFA), 1.2 FP/G (only 1 game)
		- Chris Tanev, 4.5M (UFA), 1.01 FP/G
		- Sebastian Aho (D), 825K (RFA), 1.1 FP/G
		- Max Pacioretty, 4M, LTIR 
	- With term:
		- Yegor Sharangovich, 3.1M, 1 more year, 1.39 FP/G
		- Jalen Chatfield, 7625K, 1 more year 0.9 FP/G (should have dropped when TDA signed...)
