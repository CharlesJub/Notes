# Notes:
- Inverted pyramid
	- Start your day with the most important thing
	- Spend the most time on the most important thing
	- Spend less time on each subsequent task 
	- 3-2-1 hours per task is a simple way to break down tasks
- Feel good work: productivity done for the sake of productivity
- Continuously think about what the most important thing to get done is and do it 
- Really think about what you need to do, don't let your feeling control this 
- If you can't concentrate, don't try to push through. Just take a break
- Don't take a break by mindless scrolling. Exercise 
- High intensity exercise 
- Don't multitask
