## Notes 
Analytics Lifecycle is 3 steps: data collection, data analysis, implementation/inference 
Important to make sure data is good so inferences can be good
**Population** is all objects of interest
**Sample** is subset of population that data is collected on 
**Parameter** is measure of the population. Typically conceptual 
**Statistic** is a measure of the sample. 
Sampling can be bad if with bias
**Bias** is occurs when the sample does not reflect the entire population
Two common types of bias are selection bias and sampling bias
**Selection bias** is bias by lack of information whether it be because your sample isn't representative of the entire population (**Undercoverage**) or the sample selected doesn't provide data (**Nonresponse**)
**Sampling Bias** occurs when the sample is not selected through proper means. This can be a sample selected out of ease (**Convivence**) or an sample collected by the people that want to be recognized in the sample (Voluntary**).**
Four common sampling techniques to reduce bias: Simple Random Sampling, Stratified Random Sampling, Cluster Sampling, Systematic Sampling
**Simple Random Sampling** is randomly selecting a sample from the population. This has no statistical bias and needs no information about the sample beforehand. Its disadvantages are it is costly to do and needs entire population. 
**Stratified Random Sampling** is dividing the sample into groups based on a characteristic and selecting a random sample from each of the groups (keeping the proportion of the population). This is good because it needs less sample size to produce similar accuracy to SRS because it produces sample that better represents the population. Its disadvantages are that it needs information about the sample before the split.
