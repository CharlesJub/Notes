## Notes: 
- Most of the learning that comes from lectures comes from before and after the lecture 
- Lecturing isn't used because it is necessarily the most effective way of teaching, but because it is tradition and low cost for many people.
- Don't go into the lecture cold. Go into it with some information about the topic you're going to learn about. It's okay if you go in without a complete understanding.
- To make the most of pre-assigned reading, read as much as you can deeply instead of sacrificing understanding for quantity read. 
- Reasons for prep: Reduce cognitive load. Create network of prior knowledge to link ideas in lecture. Get relevant practice. Begin organizing ideas.
- During the lecture it is important to make sense of the lecture. Decipher the links between the examples.
- When the lecture is online, make use of the ability to pause and go back. If you aren't pausing for ~20 minutes you might not be getting the full idea. 
- Many ways to review what you have learned in the lecture but make sure it tests your ability to recall the information 
- Use the frameworks of each discipline to guide you in your review. For example in math there are formulas and proofs. 
- Many ways to prep and review, but a little bit of each goes a long way and early efforts make a huge difference later on.
