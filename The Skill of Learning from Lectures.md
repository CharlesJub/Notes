Notes: 
- Most of the learning that comes from lectures comes from before and after the lecture 
- Lecturing isn't used because it is necessarily the most effective way of teaching, but because it is tradition and low cost for many people.
- Don't go into the lecture cold. Go into it with some information about the topic you're going to learn about. It's okay if you go in without a complete understanding.
- To make the most of pre-assigned reading, read as much as you can deeply instead of sacrificing understanding for quantity read.
