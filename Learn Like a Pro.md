An important part of making new connections is health. Being active can improve the amount of connections made when learning. Sleep and certain foods can also help this process

To maximize short-term memory:
- Break material into chunks.
- Make info more understandable

- Use split notes (left side big idea, right side more detailed)
- Do review of the notes at the end of the day you take them
- Try to actively recall the key ideas
