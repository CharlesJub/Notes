- Skill gap. Don't have the skills to do a task
- Resource gap. Don't have the support, money, energy to do a task
- Can be a combination of things 
- Perfectionism
- Forgetfulness. 
- Overly optimistic thinking. Thinking you have the time to do something that you don't. Adjust the goal. Think about how many things you're trying to do
