# Notes 
- Body doubling: working with someone in the room to provide a passive pressure to get work done.
- Monotasking: one task at a time. Pomodoro technique.
- Motivation bridge: filling in the gap between intending to do something and actually doing something. 3 ways: make it urgent, make it new, make it personal interesting. Think about if you need to add urgency, challenge, or ease.
- Exercise.
- Point of performance: put everything you need to do a task in the same area.
